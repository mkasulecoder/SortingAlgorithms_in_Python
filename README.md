### Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. They allow us to organize data efficiently, making it easier to search, analyze, and manipulate. Understanding different sorting algorithms and their complexities is crucial for any programmer.

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of popular sorting algorithms in Java, along with explanations and visualizations to aid understanding.

### Algorithms Covered

1. **Selection Sort**: Simple and intuitive, but with poor performance compared to more advanced algorithms.
2. **Insertion Sort**: Efficient for small datasets and largely sorted data.
3. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with excellent average and worst-case time complexity.
4. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm known for its fast average performance.
5. **Heap Sort**: Based on the heap data structure, offering O(n log n) performance.
6. **Radix Sort**: Ideal for sorting integers or fixed-length strings with a limited range of values.

Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations of how it works, its time and space complexities, and when it's best suited for use.

### How to Use

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone [git@github.com:mkasulecoder/SortingAlgorithms_in_Python.git](git@github.com:mkasulecoder/SortingAlgorithms_in_Python.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd sorting-algorithms-in-java
   ```

3. Explore the directory to find implementations of different sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is contained within its own Java file, along with comments explaining the code.

4. Compile and run the Java files to see the sorting algorithms in action. You can use the provided test data or create your own datasets to experiment with.

5. Feel free to modify the code, add your own algorithms, or improve existing implementations. Contributions are welcome!
